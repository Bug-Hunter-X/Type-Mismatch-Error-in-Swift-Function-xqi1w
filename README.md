This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: type mismatches in function arguments. The `bug.swift` file contains code that attempts to pass a String to a function expecting an Int. This leads to a runtime error. The solution, found in `bugSolution.swift`, addresses this by ensuring that all function arguments have the correct type.
